# LetUsOrder
LetUsOrder is an eStore where a user can explore multiple categories and can add products to the cart so to buy them. Users even got the functionality to sell products from their own shops if any.

### Technology Used: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, along with JSP, Java Servlets, JDBC with MySQL, Jakarta's
Mail API for sending auto-generated emails (such as OTP for Account Verification & Recovery and Order Confirmation
at Checkout) and Haversine (for automatically selecting closest seller before checking out).
